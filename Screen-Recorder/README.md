# Screen Recorder
I tried to recreate the Windows screenshot tool, and then I added a function to capture gifs. <br>
It was my second attemp to make a GUI, but this time with PyQt.

What it does:
- let the user choose between capturing png or gif
- Freeze the screen until the user select the area he wants to capture
- In case of png: capture the area on the screen, display the image and copy it to the clipboard
- In case of gif: create a marking area on the screen, let the user start and finish the capture, and then display the gif
