Communication software that uses a lot of my previous work gathered under a toolkit. This makes it easier to create frameless applications, create scroll areas, threads, animations, handle logs or xml files or even update the application. <br>

You can create sessions with passwords and communicate regardless of the number of participants. Work both for local or global network. You can connect via IP address or by using a menu that shows the latest servers joined.<br>

The host has access to many more parameters, such as setting a password, automatically accepting or rejecting newcomers, re-sharing files, banning or expelling participants.
