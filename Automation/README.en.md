# Automation
Automation software
Automation software, configurable in a "no-code" way. Created in a way that makes it easy to add features. <br>
I developed this software in order to have an easy way to create automations without having to code a new program each time. <br>

What can be done:
* You can place as many nodes as you want, they will be executed one after the other
* The nodes are:
    * Time: wait for a certain moment (in seconds) or a specific time
    * Keyboard: simulate a key or shortcut by tapping, pressing or releasing it
    * Mouse: simulate moving, clicking or scrolling with the mouse
    * Checkpoint: wait for specific input from the user before moving on
* Nodes can be added, inserted, deleted or even moved to change their order
* For each node, you can choose to enable whether or not a message will be displayed in the logs each time it is executed
* Nodes can be saved to a file and loaded again whenever desired
* In case of emergency, you can press a key (modifiable) three times to stop the loop
* This software can be updated using another software of mine called Updater

There is a "record" mode which allows you to create complex node systems easily

It is possible to translate all texts in the software with just one click
