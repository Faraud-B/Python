# Automation
Software to automate tasks, configurable in a "no code" way. Created to make it easy to add new features. <br>
I created this software to have an easy way to create automations without having to create a new program each time. <br>

What it does:
* You can place as much nodes as yout want, they will run one after the other
* Nodes are:
   * Time: wait for a certain amount of time (in seconds) or a specific hour
   * Keyboard: simulate a key or a shortcut in tap, press or release mode
   * Mouse: simulate a mouse move, click or scroll input
   * Checkpoint: wait for a specific input from the user to continue
* Nodes can be added, inserted, removed and even dragged and dropped to change their order
* For each node, you can enable whether or not a message will be written to the log file each time it is passed.
* The succession of nodes can be stored in a file to be loaded later
* In case of emergency, you can press a key three times to trigger the end of the loop
* You can update this software easily using my other software called Updater
