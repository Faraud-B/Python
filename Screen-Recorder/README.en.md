# Screen Recorder
I tried to recreate the Windows screenshot tool and then added a function to capture gifs. <br>

What can be done:
* You can choose between capturing a png or a gif
* Freeze the screen until the user selects the area they want to capture
* In case of png: the area on the screen is captured, displayed and copied to the clipboard
* In case of gif: a marking area is displayed on the screen, the user can then start the capture and finish it when they wish
<br>
