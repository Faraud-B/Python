# Chat
Communications software. Allows you to create sessions to communicate and share documents with a large number of participants. <br>

What can be done:
* You can create a session on the local network but also remotely, using the IP address to connect
* Clients have access to the list of the last 5 servers they joined, with an indicator to know if they are still active or not, so they can simply return to them
* Once in the session it is possible to send messages or files at will
* It is possible to change your name during a session
* During the session, the host can change the password, accept or reject new participants, reshare files or even exclude participants
* This software can be updated using another software of mine called Updater.
