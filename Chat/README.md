# Chat
Communication software. Allows you to create sessions with passwords and communicate regardless of the number of participants. <br>
This software uses a lot of my previous work gathered under a toolkit. This makes it easier to create frameless applications, create scroll areas, threads, animations, handle logs or xml files or even update the application. <br>

What it does:
* You can connect as host (which will create a server) and add a password if you want
* You can connect as a client either
     * with the IP adress of the server
     * using the list of previously joined servers with an indicator to see if the server is online or not
* Once your connected, you can send messages or share data (not matter their size)
* You can change your name at any time
* The host can evict clients
